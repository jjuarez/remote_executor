= Remote Executor: 

A simplistic remote command launcher over SSH conections

== Installing
    
The latest stable version is published in rubygems.

  gem install remote_executor

== Notes

At the moment the gem have a strong dependency of your local SSH configuration, commonly located at ${HOME}/.ssh/config, this is only
a very simple mechanism for keep safe your private data, but this need a ugly configuration with a fake user name in the connection 
process. I provide a basic SSH config if your arenÂ´t familiar with this configuration stuff

== Options
  * config   = Valid YAML configuration file
  * log      = File for the log
  * commands = A list of commands separated by ';'
  * threaded = [true, false]: Execute the command in batch mode (false) or in parallel (true) in a server of a system

=== Configuration file example

  ---
    - :name: 'myFarm1'
      :environment: 'development'
      :user: 'admin'
      :hosts: 
        - 'myHost1'
        - 'myHost2'
        - 'myHost3'
        - 'myHost4'
    - :name: 'myFarm2'
      :environment: 'production'
      :user: 'admin'
      :hosts: 
        - 'myHost1'
        - 'myHost2'
        - 'myHost3'
        - 'myHost4'

you need this minimal SSH configuration (${HOME}/.ssh/config) for the example

  Host myHost1
    HostName myhost1.example.com
    
  Host myHost2
    HostName myhost2.example.com
    
  Host myHost3
    HostName myhost3.example.com
    
  Host myHost4
    HostName myhost4.example.com
    
  *.example.com
    User admin
  
with this line: 

  remote_executor --config=MyFarmsConfigurationFile.yml \
    --threaded=true \
    --log=/tmp/MyFarmResults.log \
    --system=myFarm1 \
    --commands='hostname;cat /etc/hosts;grep foo /etc/passwd'

     
== TODO

* Take decisions about user by hosts or user by farm
* Pullrequests are welcome... of course
