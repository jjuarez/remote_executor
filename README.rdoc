= Remote Executor: 

A simplistic remote command launcher over SSH conections

== Installing
    
The latest stable version is published in rubygems.

  gem source --add http://rubygems.org
  gem install remote_executor

== Notes

At the moment the gem have a strong dependency of your local SSH configuration, commonly located at ${HOME}/.ssh/config, this is only
a very simple mechanism for keep safe your private data, but this need a ugly configuration with a fake user name in the connection 
process. I provide a basic SSH config if your arenÂ´t familiar with this configuration stuff

=== How to use

An example may be the next. Launch the command 'hostname' over your production farm system named 'myFarm' configured in your home 
directory into the file ${HOME}/.remoteexecutorrc like this:
  
  ---
    - :name: 'myFarm'
      :environment: 'development'
      :user: 'admin'
      :hosts: 
        - 'myHost1'
        - 'myHost2'
        - 'myHost3'
        - 'myHost4'
    - :name: 'myFarm'
      :environment: 'production'
      :user: 'admin'
      :hosts: 
        - 'myHost1'
        - 'myHost2'
        - 'myHost3'
        - 'myHost4'

you need this minimal SSH configuration (${HOME}/.ssh/config) for the example

  Host myHost1
    HostName myhost1.example.com
    
  Host myHost2
    HostName myhost2.example.com
    
  Host myHost3
    HostName myhost3.example.com
    
  Host myHost4
    HostName myhost4.example.com
    
  *.example.com
    User admin
  
with this line: 

  remote_executor --system=myFarmID --command='hostname'

     
== TODO

* Document all this stuff in english... I promise
* Take decisions about user by hosts or user by farm
* Pullrequests are welcome... of course
